#### MIPS Assembly Project

##### Note: In order to run the project u should have QtSpim MIPS Simulator installed.

Write a full assembly program that takes two floating point numbers and record each as two integer variables before the decimal point and after the decimal point. Your program will have three subroutines: add, subtract and multiply. You are not allowed to use floating point instructions. You can only use integer instructions. Handling negative numbers will get extra 15 points. Ex: 3.735 + 7.22 will output = 10.955 (Assume all parts can be represented by 32-bit integers)
